# FrontRow

## Managed AI Outbound for B2B

FrontRow provides an end-to-end, fully managed outbound service for B2B companies. You sign a monthly engagement and we run the campaigns for you. Before we start, we collect a small set of inputs about your company and products such as your website, LinkedIn, and a short description. After that, we handle the rest and every message is delivered with hyper-personalization.

## What We Deliver

### Audience Design and Lookalike Modeling

We define or refine your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and use machine learning to create lookalike company lists that resemble your existing customers or the companies you want to target. We support include and exclude lists and we suppress duplicates across your account.

### Research That Makes Messages Relevant

Using only sources you approve—such as company websites, LinkedIn company and personal pages, review platforms, funding databases, and web search—we gather context and map exactly which fields will be used in each email.

### AI-Written Plain Text Emails with Hyper-Personalization

An enterprise-grade LLM stack turns the research into concise one-to-one emails. Our two-stage approach first selects the most relevant data points, then writes the email anchored to those facts.

### Deliverability as a First Principle

We invest heavily to land in the primary inbox and we back that with optional email verification, sending from Google/Outlook or SMTP, per-lead timezone scheduling, safe daily limits, follow-ups, and optional retargeting touches. We currently perform at 2x the market.

### Measurement and Continuous Improvement

We analyze outcomes, refine ICPs and messaging, create lookalike campaigns based on what works, and when appropriate, reuse recently processed leads to speed execution.

## How We Work

### 1. Discovery and Profiling

You share your website and LinkedIn plus a short product description, file, or URL. We analyze these with AI to create clear, editable summaries of your company and product.

### 2. Audience Design

We propose ICP filters such as industries, company sizes, roles, and geographies—or follow your direction. You can provide include or exclude lists and a lead cap. We remove duplicates across your campaigns and account.

### 3. Research Plan

Together we confirm which sources to use. We gather only from those sources and we predefine which specific details will appear in each email so hyper-personalization is always backed by evidence.

### 4. Messaging and Generation

We select a copy approach such as value-focused or problem-solution. An enterprise-grade LLM stack turns approved data into clear plain text emails tailored to each person.

### 5. Execution

We connect the sending inboxes through Google/Outlook or SMTP and manage daily windows, each lead's local time, follow-ups, and optional retargeting touches. If needed, we can discuss warmed inbox options.

### 6. Measurement and Lookalike Expansion

We monitor results, adjust targeting and prompts, and build lookalike campaigns that compound performance over time with hyper-personalization at scale.

## Technology You Can Trust

Our platform combines enterprise-grade LLMs with lead data providers, an email verification partner, a controlled scraping pipeline, and secure inbox integrations with Google/Outlook and SMTP. Workflows are orchestrated event-by-event and recent lead data can be reused when appropriate to accelerate delivery while respecting your approval and privacy controls.

## Our Principles

- **Automation by default** with clear client approvals
- **Hyper-personalization** grounded in verified sources
- **Deliverability and clarity** over tricks and noise
- **Fast time to value** with continuous learning

## Outcome

You do not build lists or write emails. FrontRow delivers targeted outreach with hyper-personalization, strong deliverability, and learning loops that improve results month after month.
