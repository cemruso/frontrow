We are building a landing page for a company called Frontrow.
Frontrow is a lead generation company.
It operates with a services and SaaS model.
Competitors include Amplemarket, Unifygtm, Lemlist, Fyxer.

Stack is built on Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and TypeScript.
We use Shadcn Blocks, which are pre-built components that can be used to build the landing page.

General rules:
Do NOT write documentations in MD unless asked for.
Always write reusable dry code, NEVER patch.
Either remix existing components from other pages OR build with components in the ui or blocks folder.
Always use theme colors, never hardcode colors.
